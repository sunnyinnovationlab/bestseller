The war is over. Holdfast is dead. The Eternal Flame extinguished. There’s no one left for you to save'\nOnce a promising alchemist, Helena Marino is now a prisoner — of war and of her own mind. Her Resistance friends and allies have been brutally murdered, her abilities suppressed, and the world she knew destroyed.\nIn the aftermath of a long war, Paladia’s new ruling class of corrupt guild families and depraved necromancers, whose vile, undead creatures helped bring about their victory, holds Helena captive.\nAccording to Resistance records, she was a healer of little importance within their ranks. But Helena has inexplicable memory loss of the months leading up to her capture, making her enemies wonder: Is she truly as insignificant as she appears, or are her lost memories hiding some vital piece of the Resistance’s final gambit?\nTo uncover the memories buried deep within her mind, Helena is sent to the High Reeve, one of the most powerful and ruthless necromancers in this new world. Trapped on his crumbling estate, Helena’s fight—to protect her lost history and to preserve the last remaining shreds of her former self—is just beginning. For her prison and captor have secrets of their own . . . secrets Helena must unearth, whatever the cost.",

Whether you’re an avid map junkie or simply ‘map-curious’, each chapter uncovers a unique tale of adventure, error and unexpected humour – as they attempt to answer the question: ‘What on earth happened here?’\nSo, ditch the compass (or disable location services) and set out into a world of cartographic chaos and mappy mishaps.\nBecause the worst maps are the best maps.",
