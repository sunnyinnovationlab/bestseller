    "title": "1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History--and How It Shattered a Nation",
    "author": "Andrew Ross Sorkin",
    "writerInfo": "“In 1929 Andrew Ross Sorkin brings the drama of the crash to a high pitch. He has consulted weather reports, diaries, architectural records and every newspaper imaginable to create a vivid and historically accurate account of the boom, crash, and aftermath. Although Mr. Sorkin offers hints that the crash looms larger in our memory than it did in the moment, his focus is on portraying the lives of the people who lived through it. It is one of the best narrative histories I’ve read.”\n—The Wall Street Journal\n\n“Sorkin's vivid and forensic account . . . is a real eye-opener . . . a work of true scholarship, the fruits of eight years of research by Sorkin drawing on an extensive array of materials, including personal correspondence and unpublished papers whose details have been woven into the story of the Great Crash for the first time. 1929 will have a distinct place within the Great Crash/Depression genre, just as did Too Big to Fail and for the same reasons—a people’s tragedy told through the lens of the leading players and their personalities, friends and families.”\n—The Financial Times\n\n“Mr. Sorkin wisely tells this sprawling story in a focused way, reconstructing how crucial figures experienced the ructions almost hour by hour . . . Mr. Sorkin’s coverage of the crisis in 2008 was based on hundreds of interviews, but most of the people in this tale have been dead for decades. You would be forgiven for forgetting it. The combination of extensive research and a lively tone makes both the crash and the men involved feel more recent.”\n—The Economist\n\n“It would be tempting to say that among bestselling American financial authors, Andrew Ross Sorkin is the new Michael Lewis . . . 1929 is an epic exercise in bringing history to life through its big characters. Like Too Big to Fail it will be labelled ‘definitive’—and deservedly so.”\n—Spears\n\n“A fable of greed, corruption and incompetence to shock the conscience. It’s exhilarating to watch these men rise and fall and, as in Too Big To Fail, Sorkin carries his readers along on a current of astonishing detail.”\n—The New York Times Book Review\n\n“When a story of immense historical gravity—the drama and trauma of 1929—meets a writer steeped in its scholarship and gifted with a rare clarity of vision, the result is a work of lasting resonance: tangible and immediate. In 1929, Andrew Ross Sorkin captures the moment when ambition, greed, and speculative euphoria collided to plunge America into an economic abyss, sparking the Great Depression. Through vivid storytelling and a cast of powerfully rendered characters, Sorkin reveals a nation at the breaking point—grappling with denial, reckoning, and the steep cost of excess. It’s a haunting elegy for a fractured era, and a timeless reminder that progress is fragile, choices have repercussions, and the flaws embedded in the human condition are ours to confront.”\n—Doris Kearns Goodwin, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of No Ordinary Time and An Unfinished Love Story\n\n“Andrew Ross Sorkin has done it again. 1929 is mesmerizing from beginning to end—a deeply important book. Like Too Big to Fail, it’s a masterclass in narrative nonfiction, a dazzling tale of a pivotal moment in history brought to life through meticulous reporting. The colorful characters, the politics, the financial mania—it all unfolds with eerie relevance. You feel like you’re reading about today. I was blown away.”\n—Walter Isaacson, New York Times bestselling author of Steve Jobs and Benjamin Franklin\n\n“In this glorious account of the 1929 crash, Andrew Ross Sorkin conjures up the mad euphoria, crushing collapse, and subsequent political reckoning with equal finesse. He tells the story through a rich cast of unforgettable characters and resists the urge to portray them as simple heroes or villains so much as flawed people lost in a calamity almost beyond their comprehension. This converts his saga into a timeless cautionary tale that speaks to the present no less than the past.”\n—Ron Chernow, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Mark Twain\n\n“With a storyteller’s eye and an expert’s grasp of detail, Andrew Ross Sorkin has given us an engaging and memorable account of one of the largest events in American history—the Crash of 1929. In Sorkin’s gifted hands, this is a human drama with profound consequences for democracy and for capitalism—and it is a reminder of the fragility of the things we like to think are invulnerable.”\n—Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of American Lion and And There Was Light\n\n“In Andrew Ross Sorkin's fresh and revealing telling, the stock market crash of 1929 becomes a great human drama, full of contingency and misunderstanding, friends and enemies, courage and fear, greed and generosity. Out of that financial catastrophe came many of the institutions and ideas that we still turn to in moments of crisis. But as Sorkin shows, even those with the greatest wealth and power and experience can still be caught off guard by the twists and turns of history.”\n—Beverly Gage, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of G-Man and The Day Wall Street Exploded\n\n“In this gripping account of the great crash of 1929, Andrew Ross Sorkin tells the story through the actions of a handful of the central protagonists, among them a rogue’s gallery of Wall Street bankers and speculators, living in their own make-believe world, Washington politicians grappling with forces they did not fully understand, and Federal Reserve officials torn by outside pressures. As a student of financial crises, I found fresh lessons in his pages. As you read his brilliant narrative, the tragic arc of the personal stories, mirrored by the unfolding calamity overtaking the nation at large, you cannot help but think of today.”\n—Liaquat Ahamed, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Lords of Finance\n\n“1929 is the story of the great fall, told from the vantage of a fly on the wall. That wall is Wall Street, and that fly is Andrew Ross Sorkin. This gripping account revisits timeless themes—greed, hubris, comeuppance—but it also sets that fateful year in a moment in time, at once distant, and bracingly familiar. A riveting, crucial read.”\n—Jill Lepore, New York Times bestselling author of These Truths and We the People\n\n“[Andrew Ross Sorkin] has written an absolutely riveting & illuminating account of the ’29 market crash, one that clarifies many misinterpretations & has deep resonance today.”\n—David Grann, New York Times bestselling author of The Wager",
    "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\n“It is one of the best narrative histories I’ve read.”\n—The Wall Street Journal\n\nA New York Times Notable Book of 2025 • One of Barack Obama's Favorite Books of 2025 • Named a BEST BOOK OF 2025 by TIME, The Economist, Air Mail, Bloomberg, and History\n\nFrom the bestselling author of Too Big to Fail, “the definitive history of the 2008 banking crisis,” (The Atlantic) comes a riveting narrative of the most infamous stock market crash in history—one with ripple effects that still shape our society today.\n\nIn 1929, the world watched in shock as the unstoppable Wall Street bull market went into a freefall, wiping out fortunes and igniting a depression that would reshape a generation. But behind the flashing ticker tapes and panicked traders, another drama unfolded—one of visionaries and fraudsters, titans and dreamers, euphoria and ruin.\n\nWith unparalleled access to historical records and newly uncovered documents, New York Times bestselling author Andrew Ross Sorkin takes readers inside the chaos of the crash, behind the scenes of a raging battle between Wall Street and Washington and the larger-than-life characters whose ambition and naïveté in an endless boom led to disaster. The dizzying highs and brutal lows of this era eerily mirror today’s world—where markets soar, political tensions mount, and the fight over financial influence plays out once again.\n\nThis is not just a story about money. 1929 is a tale of power, psychology, and the seductive illusion that this time is different. It’s about disregarded alarm bells, financiers who fell from grace, and skeptics who saw the crash coming—only to be dismissed until it was too late.\n\nHailed as a landmark book, Too Big to Fail reimagined how financial crises are told. Now, with 1929, Sorkin delivers an immersive, electrifying account of the most pivotal market collapse of all time—with lessons that remain as urgent as ever. More than just a history, 1929 is a crucial blueprint for understanding the cycles of speculation, the forces that drive financial upheaval, and the warning signs we ignore at our peril.",
